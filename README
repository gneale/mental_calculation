*Mental calculation* a simple tool made, to practice *anzan* - mental calculation made by visualizing a soroban, the japanese abacus.

Requirements:
=============

for the Windows version:
------------------------
All dependancies are included.
- espeak for the speech synthesis (as an option)

for the source version:
-----------------------
- python 2.6 (or higher)
- PyQt4 4.7 (or higher)
- qt 4.6 + phonon (or higher)
- espeak for the speech synthesis (as an option)

Espeak
======

*mentalcalculation* will look for *espeak* executable at its default location:
    - C:\Program Files\eSpeak\command_line\espeak.exe for Windows
    - /usr/bin/espeak for Linux

If it is found, you will be able to use Speach synthesis option to get the number spoken out automatically.

If, for any reason, *espeak* is installed in an unusual location, you can specify its path in the configuration file. See below to see how to do that.

*Espeak* will also use the language defined by your locale.
If you want to change the language used by espeak, add a section in the mentalcalculation.ini file (see below) like this:

    [Espeak]
    lang=en
    cmd=D:\\Program Files\\eSpeak\\command_line\\espeak.exe
    speed=150 ; words per minute from 80 to 390

Each of the 3 lines are optionals
    - *cmd* specify the path to the *espeak* binary
    - *lang* speciy the language to be used by *espeak*
    - *speed* is the number of word per second for *espeak* (between 80 and 390)

Configuration file
------------------
*mentalcalculation* saves its settings in a configuration file: 
On Linux/or any unix-like
  ~/.config/mentalcalculation/mentalcalculation.ini
On Windows
  C:\Documents and Settings\<your_user_name>\Application Data\mentalcalculation\mentalcalculation.ini for Windows XP
  or
  C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Roaming\mentalcalculation\mentalcalculation.ini for Windows Vista and above

You need to run *mentalcalculation*, at least once so that the configuration file is written to disk.

Note: It does not do anything to the Windows registry at all !

Custom options
==============
The colors of the foreground (i.e. the font color) and background of the display area can be changed.
Use a section like the following one in the conf. file

    [GUI]
    font_color=#F9F41C
    background_color=#000000

You must specify the colors by using HTML color codes or by explicit name. For more details, look at http://doc.qt.nokia.com/latest/qcolor.html#setNamedColor
If you look for a way to choose a color, you could use the color picker of your favorite graphic software, or go online at http://www.colorpicker.com/, or http://html-color-codes.info/. A search for "color picker" or "visual color picker" on your search engine gives you plenty of solutions too.

Sound
=====
You can have a sound played when each number is displayed on screen. You must include the following section in the conf. file

    [Sound]
    annoying_sound=true

By default, the file called annoying-sound.mp3 in the sound directory of *mentalcalculation* is used. You can change it to any sound you like. If possible, choose a file that does not last longer than 50ms, else you may encouter problem with a desynchronisation between sound and display.

The sound is played only if you don't use the speak synthesis system.

Plus sign
=========
One can remove the + sign in front of numbers if using subtraction by using this snippet in conf. file

    noplussign=true

in the [General] section of the mentalcalculation.ini

Fail-safe mechanism:
--------------------
There is a fail-safe mechanism that allows *mental calculation* to safely fail when it does not find one of its resources files. So, if you don't like the smileys/emoticons or the sounds, you can safely delete/rename them on your harddisk (img/sound directories), and *mentalcalculation* will continue to work without them.

Attribution:
============
I would like to thank the Tango project from which I borrowed some icons and the GNOME project (gnome-media, gnome-audio) for the sound files I use.
