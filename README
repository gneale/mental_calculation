Tips:
=====

You can replay a sequence (or addition/subtraction):
- If You have checked your answer already (by clicking 'Check' button), just press 'Shift' and the 'Start' button will
  become a 'Replay' button. Just click it, STILL holding the shift key!
- If you have not checked for an answer, just press the 'Tab' key to put the focus on the 'Start' button. This way, when you will press the 'Shift' key, the 'Start' button will become a 'Replay' button too. In this case, it does not work without pressing 'Tab'

Usage:
======

- If you checked 'Speech synthesis + sounds', *mentalcalculation* will attempt to use espeak for speech synthesis. It look for it at a default location: 
  - /usr/bin/espeak for Linux 
  - C:\Program Files\eSpeak\command_line\espeak.exe for Windows.
  It will also use the language defined by your locale.
  If you want to change the language used by espeak or its location path, add a section in the mentalcalculation.ini file (see below) like this:

    [Espeak]
    lang=en
    cmd=D:\\Program Files\\eSpeak\\command_line\\espeak.exe
    speed=150 ; words per minute from 80 to 390

ini file
--------
*mentalcalculation* saves its settings in a configuration file: 
On Linux/or any unix-like
  ~/.config/mentalcalculation/mentalcalculation.ini
On Windows
  C:\Documents and Settings\<your_user_name>\Application Data\mentalcalculation\mentalcalculation.ini
  or C:\Users\<your_user_name>\AppData\Roaming\mentalcalculation\mentalcalculation.ini

Note: It does not do anything to the Windows registry at all !

Fail-safe mechanism:
--------------------
There is a fail-safe mechanism that allows *mental calculation* to safely fails when it does not find one of its resources files. So, if you don't like the smileys/emoticons or the sounds, you can safely delete/rename them on your harddisk (img/sound directories), and *mentalcalculation* will continue to work without them.

Attribution:
============
I would like to thank the Tango project from which I borrowed some icons and the GNOME project (gnome-media, gnome-audio) for the sound files I use.
